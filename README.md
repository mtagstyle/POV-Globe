# PoV Globe

This repo will will be used to capture any information regarding the research, design, and implementation of a globe-shaped persistence-of-vision (PoV) display

# What is it?

A pov display uses the persistence of vision ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision)) optical illusion in order to display an image or video driven by a microcontroller. 

By moving a section of LEDs in a portion of space and turning them on at certain intervals of time, the brain will perceive that section as an entire image. Generally, this involves rotating a strip of LEDs in a circle.
